\subsection*{Supplementary Career Information}
\todo{optional; free text}
\todo[inline]{%
    You may voluntarily enter supplementary information relating to your career or special personal circumstances if you feel that this information may be relevant to the appropriate review and evaluation of your academic achievements. Examples of special personal circumstances or delays that can be recognised include periods of absence due to childcare responsibilities, maternity leave, parenting or child-rearing periods, chronic/long-term illness, a disability or particular family obligations such as caring for relatives as well as pandemic-related downtimes. Time delays in an academic career may also be indicated, e.g. for persons who are the first in their families to pursue an academic career (first-generation academics), for various compulsory and voluntary services, language acquisition, migration or integration phases, displacement or asylum procedures. Please do not mention any information about third parties, or as little as possible.\\

    This allows such things as biographical peculiarities or unavoidable delays (of at least 2-3 months per year) in your academic career to be appropriately taken into account in your favour as part of the review and comparative assessment.\\

    If you wish to provide relevant, confidential information on your personal situation (e.g. illness, disability or other hardship) in the context of your proposal, but do not wish this information to be passed on to reviewers or committee members, please only use the separate \href{http://www.dfg.de/formulare/73_01/73_01_en.pdfURL}{DFG form 73.01} (Part A). Please note that in this case, the information will not be taken into account in the review or comparative assessment, or only to a limited extent. In such cases, feel free to contact the DFG Head Office in advance (\url{chancengleichheit@dfg.de}). For further information, see \url{www.dfg.de/faq_cv}.

If available, please also provide persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI/Digital Object Identifier), preferably by stating the number, otherwise by naming the URL. Open access publications should be designated accordingly.\\

    Details of quantitative metrics such as impact factors and h-indices are not required and are not considered as part of the review.

You may also indicate other forms of academic output here, such as contributions to the (technical) infrastructure of an academic community (including in an international context) and contributions to science communication. This second category is also restricted to a maximum of ten items.

\section*{Data protection and consent to the processing of optional data}
If you provide voluntary information (marked as optional) in this CV, your consent is required. Please confirm your consent by checking the box below. 

$[\hspace{0.5cm}]$ \textbf{I expressly consent to the processing of the voluntary (optional) information, including  ``special categories of personal data''\footnote{Special categories of personal data are those ``revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and (...) genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation'' (Article 9(1) GDPR).}  in connection with the DFG's review and decision-making process regarding my proposal.} This also includes forwarding my data to the external reviewers, committee members and, where applicable, foreign partner organisations who are involved in the decision-making process. To the extent that these recipients are located in a third country (outside the European Economic Area), I additionally consent to them being granted access to my data for the above-mentioned purposes, even though a level of data protection comparable to EU law may not be guaranteed. For this reason, compliance with the data protection principles of EU law is not guaranteed in such cases. In this respect, there may be a violation of my fundamental rights and freedoms and resulting damages. This may make it more difficult for me to assert my rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (e.g. information, rectification, erasure, compensation) and, if necessary, to enforce these rights with the help of authorities or in court.

I may revoke my consent in whole or in part at any time -- with effect for the future, freely and without giving reasons -- vis-à-vis the DFG (\url{postmaster@dfg.de}). The lawfulness of the processing carried out up to that point remains unaffected. Insofar as I transmit ``special categories of personal data'' relating to third parties, I confirm that the necessary legitimation under data protection law exists (e.g. based on consent).

I have taken note of the DFG's Data Protection Notice relating to research funding, which I can access at \url{www.dfg.de/privacy_policy} and I will forward it to such persons whose data the DFG processes as a result of being mentioned in this CV.
