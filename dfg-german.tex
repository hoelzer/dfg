\subsection{Stand der Forschung und eigene Vorarbeiten}
% For renewal proposals, please report on your previous work. This report
% should also be understandable without referring to additional literature.

This is a dummy citation~\cite{Hoelzer:17}. Yeah. And another one~\cite{Gerst:18}. Wuhuh. In an older version of the template, these citations~\cite{Hoelzer:16, Desiro:18} were not shown in the ``\ref{sec:bib}~Bibliography'' section, because they are already listed as \verb=\addtocategory{reviewed}{Hoelzer:16}= and\verb=\addtocategory{nonreviewed}{Desiro:18}= in the praeambl and therefore shown in subsubsections \emph{Articles published by outlets with scientific quality \dots} and \emph{Other publications, both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed}. However, these subsubsections are deprecated since v54.01 of the DFG template! And therefore, all the four citations above will simply show up in ``\ref{sec:bib}~Project- and subject-related list of publications'' now.

\subsection{Umgang mit Forschungsdaten}
Data generated during this project will be used for scientific publications in
preprint and peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, all necessary data (such as raw
sequencing data) will be deposited in publicly available repositories
(\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/}{NCBI GEO} and
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra}{SRA}, \href{https://osf.io/}{OSF}). To
allow complete reproducibility of all analyses, the source code and executed
comands will be also made publicly available
(\href{https://github.com/}{GitHub}).  Thus, all relevant data will become
accessible for future use.
